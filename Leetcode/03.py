Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

---

Why this matters:
This is one of the most popular string-based interview questions. It teaches you how to:
- Handle dynamic windows of data
- Use hash maps for fast lookup
- Avoid brute-force and optimize using the sliding window technique

---

üß† Intuition:
We want to keep checking parts of the string (substrings) that have all **unique** characters.
As soon as we find a repeat, we should move the start of our window forward to exclude the repeating character.
By keeping track of characters and their last seen positions using a map, we can slide the window efficiently.

---

üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Approach:
1. Use a dictionary `char_map` to store the last seen index of each character.
2. Use two pointers:
   - `left` marks the start of our current substring window.
   - `right` moves through each character.
3. If a character is already in `char_map` and its last seen index is within our current window:
   - Move `left` forward to one position after that index.
4. Update the character's latest index in `char_map`.
5. Calculate the current window length as `right - left + 1`, and update `max_length` accordingly.
6. Return `max_length` after processing the whole string.

---

‚è±Ô∏è Complexity:
- Time: O(n)
  Each character is processed at most twice (once by `right`, once by `left`).
- Space: O(k)
  Where `k` is the number of unique characters in the input string (e.g. 128 for ASCII).
